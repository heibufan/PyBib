```{r}
library("reticulate")
```

* getting names of pdf opened in os
* the objective of the code is to grab the name of all pdf document currently open on my computer and then open the mendeley bib file and check if the pdf document is already in the bib file. 

*NOTE 1: I probably didnt need to use a Rmarkdown file type for such code, but since I am using Python, I assumed that reticulate only work with RMarkdown. Probably not, I could have saved the code in a normal r script file but I was too lazy to try it out and I knew that how to make it work wit .Rmd.

*NOTE 2: Since psutil package (short for python system and utlities) access computer OS, I think it might be a bit different for MAC. See ressources online [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45672468/installing-psutil-libraray-with-pip-on-osx-for-python)
